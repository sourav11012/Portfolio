            <p>
              I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science
              at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC), with a
              strong focus on web development, artificial intelligence, machine
              learning, and data science. My passion lies in using technology to
              solve complex problems and enhance user experiences. As a teaching
              assistant (TA) for the Network-Based Application Development
              course, I enjoy guiding students and helping them navigate through
              the exciting world of web technologies and backend development. I
              have 1 year of professional experience working in software
              development, particularly in web development. In addition to my
              technical expertise, I am passionate about exploring the latest
              trends in AI and machine learning. I believe in the power of
              data-driven solutions and continually work on developing my skills
              in big data analytics. When Iâ€™m not immersed in coding, I enjoy
              listening to music, watching movies, and staying active through
              sports and workouts.
