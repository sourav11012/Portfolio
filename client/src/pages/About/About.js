            <p>
              I am currently working at Sports Excitement as a Software
              Developer, with a strong focus on web development, artificial
              intelligence, machine learning, and data science.
              <br />
              My passion lies in using technology to solve complex problems and
              enhance user experiences.
              <br />
              As a teaching assistant (TA) for the Network-Based Application
              Development course, I enjoyed guiding students and helping them
              navigate through the exciting world of web technologies and
              backend development. I have 3 years of professional experience
              working in software development.
              <br /> In addition to my technical expertise, I am passionate
              about exploring the latest trends in AI and machine learning. I
              believe in the power of data-driven solutions and continually work
              on developing my skills in big data analytics.
              <br />
              When Iâ€™m not immersed in coding, I enjoy listening to music,
              watching movies, and staying active through sports and workouts.
